### My first year of college

Reading self-help books helped me to live my first year in a more productive way.
Books like Atomic Habits, Psychology of Money, and The Personal MBA, IKIGAI.

Then I build atomic habits of solving one or two competitive programming questions daily on CodeChef.
I knew Python at the time of entering college. Then we learn C, C++, frontend development, ML, playing around with Python’s libraries, Git, and GitHub.

On top of that, I have explored platforms like Kaggle, CodeChef, LeetCode, GitHub, Docker, Substack, and many more.
Now I will keep on sharing my experiences and learnings with you all.

Now let’s move on to mistakes that you should never make.

**Thinking it will be hard without giving it a try.**

I thought sometimes that it would be hard without trying it. I have wasted some of my energy on easier topics rather than learning those core, quite hard topics.
Talking specifically, I thought backend would be hard, so I should focus on frontend.
In this way I kept learning HTML, CSS, and JS. But when I tried to code in FastAPI after reading about it. It was quite easy for dealing with ML models and websites then.

**Not making connections and attending nearby tech events.**

Initially I hesitated to attend a front-end event because I did not know HTML, CSS, and JS.
But it is not TRUE; we get to know what we should do to learn frontend development by connecting with peers.
Also, it gives us exposure to that domain.
I would highly recommend you to attend tech events organized by nearby companies.
You can find most of them on [Commudle](https://www.commudle.com/)

**Communication skills**
I will not count it as my mistake but remind you to improve it.
Words skopen can not be taken back.
So think wisely about what not to say (say little and what is required).

**Side skills like design, video editing, and presentation skills.**

These skills matter when we opt for hackathons. These can confirm our selection or rejection. Other things like writing styles, tech stack, and feasibility of solution (which we think is best) matter too.
But there is no drawback to learning these skills.
